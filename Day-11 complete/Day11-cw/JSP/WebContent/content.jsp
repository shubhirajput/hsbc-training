	<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a
		member of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular, deep-chested body,
		short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its
		tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent
		mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184208 cm (72–82 in) they
		are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It is a social
		species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few
		adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually
		hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex
		and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities
		occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does
		not. Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is
		absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big
		cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at
		twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout Eurasia,
		Africa and North America, but today it has been reduced to fragmented
		populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered
		population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the
		IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have
		declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are
		untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of
		the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with
		humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>
